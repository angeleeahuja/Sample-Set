        "This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to develop a question-answering (QA) bot for a business. The model retrieves relevant information from a dataset stored in Pinecone, a vector database, and uses a generative model, Cohere's large language model, to generate coherent answers to queries. The pipeline is built using LangChain, Pinecone, and Cohere API.\n",

        "1. Document Loader: A CSV document loader is used to extract textual content from a dataset, in this case, the SQuAD dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Text Chunking: To ensure efficient retrieval, large text blocks are split into smaller chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Embedding Generation: Cohere's embedding model is used to convert text chunks into vectors that represent the meaning of the text in a high-dimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Vector Storage (Pinecone): The text embeddings are stored in Pinecone, a vector database that allows for efficient retrieval using similarity search.\n",

        "5. Retrieval QA Chain: The QA chain combines the retrieval mechanism (Pinecone) with a generative language model (Cohere) to answer queries based on the retrieved documents."

            "Answer: Frédéric Chopin was a Polish and French composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era. He was born in 1810 in Żelazowa Wola, a village located 29 miles west of Warsaw. Chopin's father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman from Lorraine who had emigrated to Poland in 1787. Chopin's mother, Justyna Krzyżanowska, was a poor relative of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom Nicolas worked. Chopin was the couple's second child and only son. He had an elder sister, Ludwika, and two younger sisters, Izabela and Emilia.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chopin was a child prodigy who completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. He settled in Paris at the age of 21 and obtained French citizenship in 1835. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chopin's works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy. He is considered a prominent symbol of the Romantic era.\n"
